# archstuff
some scripts i've made to make my live easier in my arch setup and some config files 

## main stuff
* <b><u>i3-gaps</u></b>, <b><u>picom</u></b>, <b><u>urxvt terminal</u></b>, <b>dmenu</b>, <b>polybar</b>. 

nothing much, but i like how it looks rn. i haven't really riced much tbh. 

## other software i use:
### file manager:  
 * <b><u>ranger</u></b>, <b><u>pcmanfm</u></b>
### file editors:
 * <b><u>vim</u></b>. <b>vscode</b> for really big stuff. <b>okular</b> to read pdfs. 

(i really liked <b>deepin-reader</b> but idk why the padding/margin on i3-gaps is ridiculously big, both as floating and as windowed. weird. )
### browser: 
 * <b><u>firefox</u></b>, modded and with extensions (<b><u>ublock origin</u></b>, <b>decentraleyes</b>, <b>clearURL</b>, <b>darkreader</b>)
### random and technically useless pieces of code that i find very endearing:
 * <b>cmatrix</b>, <b>cbonsai</b>, <b>asciiquarium</b> 

## stuff that i will probably add in the future
* polybar rice maybe ?
* spotify or discord rice if i actually manage to do it
* scripts to automatize stuff
