# archstuff
some scripts i've made to make my live easier in my arch setup

### main stuff
> i3-gaps, picom, urxvt terminal, (dmenu), (polybar). 
nothing much, but i like how it looks rn. i haven't really riced much tbh. 

other software i use:
### file manager:  
      > ranger, pcmanfm
### file editors:
      > vim. vscode for really big stuff. okular to read pdfs. (i really liked deepin-reader but idk why the padding/margin on i3-gaps is ridiculously big, both as floating and as windowed. weird. )
### browser: 
      > firefox, modded and with extensions (ublock origin, decentraleyes, clearURL, darkreader)
### random and technically useless pieces of code that i find very endearing:
      >cmatrix, cbonsai, asciiquarium
